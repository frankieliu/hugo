The distinction between look-aside and look-through caches is not whether data
is fetched from the cache and memory in serial or in parallel. The distinction
is whether the fetch to memory on a cache miss originates from the caller or the
cache. If the fetch to memory originates from the caller on cache miss, then
you’re using a look-aside cache. If the fetch to memory originates from the
cache on cache miss, then you’re using a look-through cache.
