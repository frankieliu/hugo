1) end-to-end description of the method (exact ACLs, packets, collected data, derivation of packet loss and path from the collected data)

End to end description:
1. measure number of packets entering a particular port and exiting at a particular port
2. use ACL permit on TTL 30 at dev1 for entering and ACL permit on TTL 31 at dev2
3. collect data via existing polling infrastructure on ACL count
4. packet loss = out - in
5. path loss measurements not relevant

2) estimates of required per agent packet rate allowing to detect chosen loss ratio with chosen statistical validity (for example 1% loss with 75% confidence in 5 minutes). A graph showing packet rate as function of target loss ratio and confidence interval would be great

This discussion is tangential, it doesn't matter if we use color sync method or other method.
The figures are the same.

3) optimal setup, i.e. the best compromise between packet rate, loss resolution, statistical confidence and time resolution - or an approach how find the optimum
