* Problems
- many black friday scenarios
- need to quickly ramp up and ramp down services 
* DevOps problems in cloud tech stacks
- different layers have different degrees of automation
  - infrastructure automated
  - platforms and applications are not
- high operational cost in platforms and pplications
  - 1000 alerts per day
* Monitoring systems and data platforms 
- alert generator
- metrics aggregator
- hosts with metric sensors
- mismatch of automation
  - monitoring components: manually configured
  - infra: fully
  - mismatch: hard to keep configs up to date
  - many false alerts, while many resources not monitored
  - overwhelming number of alerts - outage
* Monitoring as code
** configuration orchestration
- keep monitoring confs in sync with hw status
- ci/cd pipelines
- configurations treated the same way as sw code
- orchestration layer on top of monitoring components w/o modifying any of the
  componnets
- impose standard structures on all the configuration s.t. they can be
  automatically generated
* data
