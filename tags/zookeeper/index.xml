      <description>questions  what is the interface provided  simple k,v store    what are the guarantees discussed  strong and eventual consistency  chain replication  where are requests handled?  write at head read at tail   what is the dotted line going back from tail to head  reply to the &amp;ldquo;write&amp;rdquo; client - committed   why is this cheaper than other topologies  because of pipelining of the writes down the chain   what consistency does CR achieve?</description>

      <description>api  We recapped re the API. Basically try to derive it yourself. Next divide which ones are write vs read related. Note that the read related contain a watch. Note that the write related contain a version.  guarantees or promises  Next we guessed what are zookeeper promises Why have these two promises Why A-linearizable?  async vs sync  what part of the writing is async? example is large configuration file what does it mean to be pipelined and issued asynchronously  when a client issues a change, when does the system respond back with an ack?</description>
