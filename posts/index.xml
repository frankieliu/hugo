      <description>Key to paper TrueTime exposes clock uncertainty, if the uncertainty is large, Spanner slows down to wait out the uncertainty. TS reflect serialization order, external consistency, or linearizability.

      <description>Acknowledgement Taken from fun4leet&amp;rsquo;s My Calendar II wonderful article
tl;dr A max segment tree, with an incremental update function is sufficient for this problem. Max is used because such tree allows quick query of the max number of bookings given a range. Incremental update is useful because each time book is called, one needs to increment the bookings in a particular range.
Data structure 4 things: a range \([l,r]\), data, lazy flag</description>

      <title>920 Number of music playlists</title>
      <link>https://www.frankliu.org/hugo/posts/920-number-of-music-playlists/</link>

      <guid>https://www.frankliu.org/hugo/posts/920-number-of-music-playlists/</guid>
      <description>Notes on solution to Leetcode 920 Let&amp;rsquo;s take the example from the article, songs: \(\left\{abcde\right\}\), playlist: \(abacabdcbaeacbd\),
\(\bar{x} = (1,2,4,7,11)\)
For \(\bar{x}\), each number in the n-tuple indicates a position in the playlist for the first occurrence of a particular unique song. The article uses 1-indexing so I will use the same to be consistent.
As an example for the \(\bar{x}\) above, consider the playlist family:
\(p_l = (1_1,2_2,c_3,3_4,c_5,c_6,4_7,c_8,c_9,c_{10},5_{11},c_{12},c_{13},c_{14})\)</description>

      <description>intro   read-optimized social graph memcache and look-aside    The distinction between look-aside and look-through caches is not whether data is fetched from the cache and memory in serial or in parallel. The distinction is whether the fetch to memory on a cache miss originates from the caller or the cache. If the fetch to memory originates from the caller on cache miss, then youâ€™re using a look-aside cache.</description>
