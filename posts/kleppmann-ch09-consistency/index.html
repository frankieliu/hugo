<p>File storage service is not linearizable, that is two requests went into it,
one to store the image, and the other to resize the image.  What happened was
a race condition, resizer went first, and storage finished later.</p>
<p>If there is only one copy of the image, linearizability solves this problem,
why?  Because you can't resize something that hasn't been stored yet.  We
could enforce reading after write guarantees, until the write is committed
then we can do an image resize.</p>
<p>Think: simple copy of the data, and atomic operations.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="ordering-guarantees">Ordering guarantees</h2>
<h3 id="ideas-of-order">ideas of order</h3>
<ul>
<li>order of writes in a replication log</li>
<li>serializability
<ul>
<li>appearance that transactions executed in some sequential order</li>
<li>allow concurrent operation prevent conflicts with either locks or aborts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>timestamp in distributed systems</li>
<li>what is the connection between ordering, linearizability and consensus?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="order-and-causality">order and causality</h3>
<h4 id="why-important--340">why important (340)</h4>
<ul>
<li>consistent prefix (snapshot isolation)</li>
<li>causality multiple writes to replicas (multileader replication)
<ul>
<li>network delay may reorder the writes</li>
<li>in some replicas, a row may be updated before being created</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>two operations A,B
<ul>
<li>either A happened before B</li>
<li>B happened before A</li>
<li>A and B are concurrent (no causal link)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>read skew in bank account
<ul>
<li>transaction must read from a consistent snapshot, ie
<ul>
<li>must be consistent with causality, i.e. if you read an answer there
must have been question</li>
<li>read skew means you are not reading from one snapshot in time</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>write skew and phantoms, on-call example
<ul>
<li>recap dirty writes and lost updates
<ul>
<li>overwriting uncommitted data
example car sale:
<ul>
<li>writing to listing db alice/bob order, bob overwrites alice, bob gets
the car</li>
<li>writing to invoice db bob/alice order, alice overwrites bob, alice pays
for the car</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>read committed (no dirty reads, no dirty writes)
<ul>
<li>does not prevent race conditions (also a lost update problem)
counter example:
<ul>
<li>A reads counter @ 42</li>
<li>B reads counter @ 42</li>
<li>A writes counter @ 43</li>
<li>B writes counter @ 43</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>recap write skew, doctor example
<ul>
<li>both doctors check number of on-call doctors (count on all rows)
<ul>
<li>alice updates her row</li>
<li>bob updates his row</li>
<li>generalization of the lost update problem</li>
<li>in this case the update is on different records
<ul>
<li>if the update is on the same record then it is a dirty write or lost
update</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>phantom is similar to write skew problem
<ul>
<li>read some condition (room has been booked or not, username)</li>
<li>two people go ahead and book a room</li>
<li>condition has changed</li>
<li>difference here is that the condition is the absence of something
(phantom)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>serializable snapshot isolation (ssi) detects write skews by detecting
causal dependencies between transactions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>cross channel timing, bob hear alice football or image file server</li>
<li>causality imposes an ordering on events</li>
<li>causally consistent means that system obeys causality order</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="causal-vs-total-order">causal vs total order</h3>
<ul>
<li>linearizability
<ul>
<li>total order of operations, single copy, every operation is atomic,
any two operations have an order</li>
<li>there are no concurrent operations in a linearizable datastore</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>causality
<ul>
<li>two events may be concurrent, if two events are ordered if they are
causally related, and they are incomparable if they are concurrent</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>linearizability implies causal order</li>
<li>causal consistency is the strongest possible consistency model that
does not slow down due to network delay, and remain available in face
of network failures (342)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="causal-consistency">causal consistency</h3>
<ul>
<li>need to know what happened before relationships</li>
<li>used some generalized vector versioning
<ul>
<li>impractical can't keep track of everything that is read</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lamport-timestamps">Lamport timestamps</h2>
<ul>
<li>(counter, nodeID)</li>
<li>every node
<ul>
<li>keeps track of the maximum counter it has seen so far and
includes that maximum on every request</li>
<li>increases its own counter to the max</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>does not solve things when they are needed
<ul>
<li>username example:
<ul>
<li>if two users ask for a username</li>
<li>they both will have a unique Lamport timestamp
<ul>
<li>but you can't resolve it until all other nodes are checked</li>
<li>you need to know that the order is finalized</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="total-order-broadcast">total order broadcast</h2>
<ul>
<li>requires to safety guarantees
<ul>
<li>reliable delivery - no message is lost</li>
<li>total order delivery - all messages are delivered in the same order to all
nodes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>zookeeper and etcd implement total order broadcast
<ul>
<li>there is a strong connection between total order broadcast and consensus</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>state-machine replication
<ul>
<li>if every replication processes the same writes in the same order, then the
replicas will remain consistent with each other</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>total order
<ul>
<li>order is fixed at the time the messages are <strong>delivered</strong></li>
<li>way of creating a log, delivering a message is like appending to the log
<ul>
<li>all nodes must deliver the same message in the same order</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>fencing tokens
<ul>
<li>lock is determined by message order</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="linearizable-vs-total-order">linearizable vs total order</h2>
<ul>
<li>total order broadcast
<ul>
<li>asynchronous
<ul>
<li>msgs guaranteed to be delivered reliably in fixed order</li>
<li>no guarantee when message will be delivered</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>linearizability
<ul>
<li>recency guarantee
<ul>
<li>a read is guaranteed to see the latest value written</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>x footnote:
<ul>
<li>linearizable rw register is an easier problem</li>
<li>total order broadcast has no deterministic solution in the asynchronous
crash and stop model</li>
<li>klepmann not very clear here, [67,68,23,24,25]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>username example : total order + linearizable storage
<ul>
<li>CAS on a register for a user name</li>
<li>total order broadcast as an append-only log
<ul>
<li>append msg with desired user name</li>
<li>read the log, wait for msg delivery</li>
<li>check any messages claiming username</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>log entries delivered in the same order to all nodes
<ul>
<li>nodes can agree which came first</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>this method ensures linearizable write but not <strong>reads</strong>
<ul>
<li>the read will have sequential consistency (timeline consistency)
but it won't have recency guarantee</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>alternatives to linearizable reads
<ul>
<li>sequence the reads by appending to the log</li>
<li>log allows fetching the position of the latest log</li>
<li>read from a replica that is synchronously updated on writes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>how to get total order broadcast from linearizable storage
<ul>
<li>for every message you get from a linearizable register</li>
<li>how is this different from Lamport time stamp?
<ul>
<li>the sequence numbers have no gaps</li>
<li>node delivered 4, and received a 6, must wait for 5 before delivering 6</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>linearizable compare and set register and total order broadcast are equivalent
to consensus</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="consensus-intro">Consensus intro</h2>
<ul>
<li>getting several nodes to agree on something
<ul>
<li>build up: replication, transactions, linearizability, total order broadcast,
consensus</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>use case:
<ul>
<li>leader election
<ul>
<li>leadership position might be contested in case of network failure
<ul>
<li>cannot have two leaders - both would accept writes and data would
diverge</li>
<li>nodes must agree on who is the leader</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>atomic commit
<ul>
<li>all nodes must agree on the outcome of the transaction all or nothing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>impossibility of consensus - FLP result
<ul>
<li>not in practice, because systems can have timeouts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="atomic-commit-and-two-phase-commit">Atomic commit and two phase commit</h2>
<ul>
<li>single node
<ul>
<li>commit depends on the order in which data is durably written to disk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>multi-node cases
<ul>
<li>multi-object transaction in a partitioned db</li>
<li>term-partitioned secondary index</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>cannot allow individual node to commit because some may abort
<ul>
<li>necessary for read committed isolation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>how is this different from two phase locking?
<ul>
<li>2PL provides serializable isolation
<ul>
<li>prevents dirty writes, write skew, and lost updates</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2PC provides atomic commit in a distributed database</li>
