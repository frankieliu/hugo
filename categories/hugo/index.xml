      <description>hugo social buttons It stated with wanting to add social buttons on my web page. This was as easy as changing the config.toml file. For Ananke theme, it is looking for some parameters, in the [params] sections. Just add you link to facebook, twitter, etc as facebook = &amp;quot;https://www.facebook.com/ID&amp;quot;.
case of missing id I was upset that it had a slack link available, but no discord one. One because I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what is one&amp;rsquo;s slack id.</description>

      <description>deploying hugo to github.io There are a number of ways of doing this. Since I like to keep a separate branch for the deployment, I opted for the option below. Another option would be use a docs directory and add to config.toml a line with publishDir = &amp;ldquo;docs&amp;rdquo;. This would also work, and you then just need to work on master branch.
This method of maintaining a separate branch is made easier with a worktree that directly writes to a public folder in gh-pages from the master branch.</description>
