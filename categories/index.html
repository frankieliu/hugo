      deploying hugo to github.io There are a number of ways of doing this. Since I like to keep a separate branch for the deployment, I opted for the option below. Another option would be use a docs directory and add to config.toml a line with publishDir = &ldquo;docs&rdquo;. This would also work, and you then just need to work on master branch.
This method of maintaining a separate branch is made easier with a worktree that directly writes to a public folder in gh-pages from the master branch.

tl;dr A max segment tree, with an incremental update function is sufficient for this problem. Max is used because such tree allows quick query of the max number of bookings given a range. Incremental update is useful because each time book is called, one needs to increment the bookings in a particular range.

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Notes on solution to Leetcode 920 Let's take the example from the article, songs: \(\left\{abcde\right\}\), playlist: \(abacabdcbaeacbd\),
\(\bar{x} = (1,2,4,7,11)\)
For \(\bar{x}\), each number in the n-tuple indicates a position in the playlist for the first occurrence of a particular unique song. The article uses 1-indexing so I will use the same to be consistent.
As an example for the \(\bar{x}\) above, consider the playlist family:
\(p_l = (1_1,2_2,c_3,3_4,c_5,c_6,4_7,c_8,c_9,c_{10},5_{11},c_{12},c_{13},c_{14})\)
Here I have used the numbers (characters) \(1-5\), to indicate a song number, instead of the \(a-e\) in the article.

      This is a commentary on the solution from Benjamin Qi.
from permutation to tree generation Before we go into the solution of this problem it is good to be able to understand how to create a tree using a permutation.
First how does a permutation \(a\) translate into a tree? Think of \(a[i]\) as the time in which node \(i\) is inserted to the tree. We'll use the following \(a=42315\) for illustration.
